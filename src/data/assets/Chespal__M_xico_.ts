    "Through EthicHub’s protocol, anyone can lend capital to the farmers and/or stake collateral on their behalf in the form of Ethix to secure the farmers’ loans. EthicHub also provides farmers with access to added value markets so they are no longer the weakest link in the supply chain.Let's not get left behind! A community that is situated on a medium height of 930 meters above sea level. In addition, it is located within the municipality of tapachula, chiapas, mexico. The total population of this community counts 703 people, 322 are male and 381 female. Due to its geographical situation, its people, who are dedicated to coffee cultivation, have been forced to seed in the steep hillsides of the mountains. This makes it difficult to carry out their works on the coffee plantations. Nevertheless, and against all odds they have prevailed and overcome natural disasters like the stan phenomenon, that left them cut off from communications for months and losing a large part of their harvest due to the intensity of the rain.",
