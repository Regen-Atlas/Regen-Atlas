    "NFT issued to buyers of Plastic Cleanup Forward Contracts.\n\nPlásticos Güell is a company committed to a sustainable world and a vision of the future based on innovation, efficiency, respect and diversity. In their case they do not recycle plastic that comes directly from the environment because they do not have the machinery to be able to clean it. However, they are collaborating with the social initiative of solidarity caps. They buy bottle caps (water bottles, detergent bottles, etc.) from associations that collect them from households for charitable purposes.",
