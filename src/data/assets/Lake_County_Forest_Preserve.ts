In total, 2,660 trees representing 24 species were installed at the preserves. The planting areas were varied and ranged from restoration of retired agricultural fields to enlarging and enhancing existing woodlands. All project sites had the overall goal of restoring the historic tree diversity and canopy structure/density that existed prior to settlement (~early 1800s).",
