  description:
    "Glow is a cryptoeconomic system that produces high additionality carbon credits from cost effective solar farms. Additionality is achieved by requiring participating solar farms to contribute 100% of their gross electricity revenue to the Glow incentive pool. Cost effectiveness is ensured by creating a competition for rewards modeled after Bitcoinâ€™s proof-of-work incentives.",
