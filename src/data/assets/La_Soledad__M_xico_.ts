The La Soledad community is also eager to send their excellent coffee nano-lots to a wider market in Europe. By investing in this project you collaborate so that this wonderful coffee is enjoyed in new horizons, some with a view to fair trade and constant improvement. Not only does the La Soledad community benefit, EthicHub benefit not just from receiving economic interests, but also you bring this product to European daily places.",
