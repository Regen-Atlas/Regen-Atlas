  description:
    'NFT issued to buyers of Plastic Cleanup Forward Contracts.\n\nPlastic Corporation is a company created in response to the contamination problem that exists along the Chira Valley, Per√∫. Around 410 TN of plastic waste from banana bags are being burned, buried, or left outdoors. They have been able to raise awareness among producers and recyclers in their surrounding areas to collect this material and other plastic waste (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS), including some that are not recycled (No. 7) and thus become our suppliers, which generates a possibility of economic improvement for the community. They transform this plastic waste together with vegetable waste (rice husks) into an innovative product called "plastic wood", thus giving a second life to single-use plastics and turning them into resistant, durable, impermeable, non-flammable, non-toxic structural units that avoid the felling of trees.',
