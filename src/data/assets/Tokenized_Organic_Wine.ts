  description:
    "OpenVino enables wineries to mint fungible tokens backed by bottles of wine. For each vintage (label), a winery can issue ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, equivalent to the number of bottles produced annually. One vintage token is worth one bottle of organic wine. Wine tokens are available for buy and sell anytime after the harvest on Viniswap, and when the wine is ready for consumption, token holders can redeem their tokens for bottles. During the redeem process, the buyer pays the shipping costs and their tokens are “burned”. Costaflores Organic Vineyard is a boutique winery located in Mendoza, Argentina, one single vineyard,  three organic grapes: Malbec, Petit Verdot, and Cabernet Sauvignon. Costaflores produces MTB* Mike Tango Bravo, a red wine (blend).",
