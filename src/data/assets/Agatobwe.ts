    "description": "Agatobwe is a hydroelectric plant situated in Rwanda, Africa, developed by Malthe Winje AS (MW), est. 1922, a Norwegian infrastructure developer with 15 years of footing in East Africa. MW has support from Norwegian government agencies NORAD, Norec, and NORFUND and is well positioned to scale crucial renewable energy infrastructure in Africa. Nonetheless, MW is underserved by traditional finance. Realizing the potential of Decentralized Finance(DeFi), MW seeks to re-finance its operational projects by issuing debt on Ethereum. The “AgaTobwe Token bond” (ATT) is the first in a series of Digitized Green Bonds backed by MW projects.",
