    "description": "This NFTree represents a tangible environmental investment, offering a direct link to a real tree within a mixed forest in the Aragon region of Spain, managed by Coorest. Scheduled for planting in March 2023, this second batch includes native species like Oak (Quercus ilex), Sabina (Juniperus phoenicea), Pinus Halepensis, and Pinus uncinate. NFTree owners are entitled to 250 CCO2 tokens annually, mirroring the CO2 absorption of the trees, with 1kg of CO2 equating to 1 CCO2 token. These tokens can be utilized within the Coorest platform for claiming, trading, or converting into a Proof of Carbon Compensation Certificate (PoCC).",
