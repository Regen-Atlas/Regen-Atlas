  description:
    "Established in 1964, Pian Upe Wildlife Reserve in Uganda covers 2153.8 kmÂ² and is crucial for conservation, hosting the country's largest variety of large plains mammals and the only extensive grassland in eastern Uganda's Karamoja region. It also supports important bird species, recognized by BirdLife International. However, the reserve faces financial challenges, struggling with insufficient funding for management, exacerbated by decreased tourism from the COVID-19 pandemic. This has led to poor infrastructure, inadequate equipment, and understaffing, threatening ecosystem health, species conservation, and local livelihoods.",
