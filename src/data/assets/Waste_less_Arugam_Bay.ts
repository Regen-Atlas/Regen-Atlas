    "description": "NFT issued to buyers of Plastic Cleanup Forward Contracts.\n\nPoor waste management in Sri Lanka is causing upsetting environmental biodiversity problems. Municipal waste is regularly discarded in open garbage dumps, many of which are located near protected areas and wildlife habitats. Waste is turning dumpsites into death traps for Sri Lankan elephants, which means they are inadvertently eating large amount of plastic and dying from it.​​ Plastic waste circulating in the Bay of Bengal end of on Sri Lankan beaches as well as domestic waste that is discarded along rivers and beaches. Waste less Arugam Bay (WLAB) is a project founded by Lanka Upcycles in 2018, that works with local people of Arugam Bay on the east coast of Sri Lanka, cleaning up jungle areas that are home to Sri Lankan elephants, beaches and provides waste management to tourism industry which is a large polluter. Using precious plastic machines, the project collects and crushes plastic to send off to the recycling center. Less plastic ends up in the environment, saving the lives of animals, and everyone has cleaner drinking water as a result of less waste leakage.",
