    "The FSM-REDD Project by Florestal Santa Maria S/A (FSM) is set in Colniza, Mato Grosso, Brazil, within the heavily deforested area known as the Deforestation Arch. This initiative aims to prevent the emission of 29,923,331 tCO2 over 30 years by protecting 71,714 hectares of native forest on FSM's private land, Fazenda Florestal Santa Maria. FSM emphasizes socio-environmental development, collaborating with a neighboring State Park to establish fire brigades and partnering with Colniza City Hall to launch technical forestry schools for local youth education.",
