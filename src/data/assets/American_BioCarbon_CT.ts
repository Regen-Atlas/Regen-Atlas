  description:
    "American BioCarbon (ABC) is at the forefront of carbon technology innovation, utilizing patented biomass separation technology to produce premium biochar from sugar cane bagasse, an agricultural byproduct. By transforming bagasse, which would otherwise be burned or decay, into biochar, ABC helps mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, supports sugar mills and local growers, and promotes a circular economy where waste is continually repurposed. Their biochar not only captures carbon effectively due to its unique honeycomb structure, enhancing soil quality and stability, but also supports sustainable development goals by reducing air pollution and providing economic benefits through the creation of CO2 Removal Certificates.",
