  description:
    "Allegheny Land Trust has conserved 124 acres of forest in Allegheny County, safeguarding it from nearby residential development. This 40-year-old woodland, featuring maple, cherry, and oak-hickory trees, serves as a habitat for wildlife like deer and turkey, and is a popular spot for hiking, bird-watching, and mountain biking. Positioned within the Youghiogheny River Watershed, just five miles from the Monongahela River, it plays a key role in providing clean drinking water to the Pittsburgh area. Funds from carbon credits support the acquisition, stewardship, and expansion of these conservation lands.",
