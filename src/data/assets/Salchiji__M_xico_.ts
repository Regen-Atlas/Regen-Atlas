  description:
    "Through EthicHub’s protocol, anyone can lend capital to the farmers and/or stake collateral on their behalf in the form of Ethix to secure the farmers’ loans. EthicHub also provides farmers with access to added value markets so they are no longer the weakest link in the supply chain. Salchiji is a small town located in Sierra Madre de Chiapas, within the Soconusco region. The farmers from the Group of Salchiji, who participate in EthicHub live between mountains from where you can see eye catching landscapes but it is isolated from the center which makes it difficult for them to have access to direct marketing channels for the sale of their crops. From their homes, it takes more than two hours to reach the nearest city, despite having paved roads. They cultivate in steep hillsides located more than 1,500 meters above sea level. These geographical conditions favour the production of high-quality coffee with higher yield and better characteristics in cup: acidity, aroma and consistency.",
