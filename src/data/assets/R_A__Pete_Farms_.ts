  description:
    "Petersen Farms has been around for over 100 years. They are a very progressive farm utilizing the latest technology for better efficiency. They practice no-till and strip-till, where they don't disturb the soil. They find that with less disturbance of soils, their yields have improved. This also means less passes across the field with equipment, which takes less workforce, less fuel and fewer hours on our equipment. The last couple of years they have started using cover crops. They believe that it will help with soil health by keeping plants growing year round. Their farm is always looking for ways to be more efficient and environment-friendly.",
