  description:
    "NFT issued to buyers of Plastic Cleanup Forward Contracts. The annual plastic consumption in Chile is around 1 million tons, of which only 7% is recycled. Collection and sorting facilities are limited, despite the number of small manual sorting systems, such as the system developed by Reciclador Chile. The lack of automatic and modern infrastructure explains how much the society relies on these smaller projects to keep their communities clean and to recycle in higher rates.​​ Reciclador Chile is a company located in the province of Valparaiso, Chile, committed to caring for the environment and communities by implementing a system to manage solid waste and its recovery in an efficient and timely manner.",
