  description:
    "Set within a lush broadleaf forest, the project area, once marred by logging and degradation, is on a path to renewal through ecological restoration. Biodiversity credits emerge from this restoration, symbolizing the healing of the land. These credits, calculated using the aOCP protocol, reflect the extent of preservation, restoration, and improvement in the ecological condition of the area. This process not only revitalizes the forest but also crafts a legacy of conservation, promising a greener, more vibrant future.",
