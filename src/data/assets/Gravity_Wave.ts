  description:
    "NFT issued to buyers of Plastic Cleanup Forward Contracts.\n\nPlastic has become a ubiquitous material in our oceans. It is part of peopleâ€™s everyday life and it is a usual presence on its beaches and at sea. Every year, between 8 and 12 million tons of plastic are dumped into our seas and oceans. Only in the Mediterranean Sea (THE MOST POLLUTED SEA IN THE WORLD), 0.57 million tonnes of plastic enters its waters. This is equivalent to dumping 33,800 plastic bottles into the sea every minute. Without action, this number will keep growing as plastic waste generation in the region is expected to quadruple by 2050. If this happens, we will have more plastic than fish by that year and we are not going to allow it. So Gravity Wave is 100% COMMITTED to end with this ridiculous statistics. They are a social, circular economy and environmental awareness company, driven to solve one of humanity's greatest challenges: plastic pollution of seas and oceans. First, they clean the plastic from the seabed and transform them into long-lasting design products and high sustainable value, through a circular economy process. In addition, they prevent the plastic that already exists (specially fishing nets) from ending up back in the waters.",
