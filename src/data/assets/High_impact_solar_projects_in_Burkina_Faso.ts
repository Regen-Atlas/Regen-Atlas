  description:
    "This pool consists of 5 sites totalling 220kW. All Helios capital will be senior to a 60% junior tranche, ensuring repayment for our users even in the event of a worst case scenario. In 2019, Burkina Faso’s energy mix was dominated by biofuels and wastes, with oil products accounting for one-third of the total energy supply. In 2020, 11% of the population had access to clean cooking and only 21% had access to electricity, making Burkina Faso one of the world’s least-electrified countries.",
