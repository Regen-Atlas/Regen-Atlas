  description:
    "The Madre de Dios Amazon REDD Project consists of 100.000 hectares of rainforest, located in the Peruvian Amazon, only 400 km from the historic sanctuary of Machu Picchu, the “Lost City of the Incas”. The area is located less than 30 km to the side of the new inter-oceanic road that has recently united Brazil with the Peruvian ports. The project is within the region that belongs to the Ecological Corridor Vilcabamba-Amboró, one of the world’s greatest biodiversity hotspots. MCO2 (“Moss Carbon Credit”) is a blockchain-based ERC20 token that represents ownership of one carbon credit (i.e., a digital certificate in the voluntary market that attests the avoidance of the emission of 1 ton of GEE in carbon dioxide equivalent units) registered with a globally recognized registry.",
