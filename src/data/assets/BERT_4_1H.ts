  description:
    "We are fighting climate change by shutting down leaking old oil and gas wells, permanently trapping millions of tonnes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ground where it belongs.This oil and gas well, which began producing in 2013, sits in the Missouri River basin. Situated in the eastern Montana plains, this area is home to vital species such as moose, black bear and gray wolf.",
