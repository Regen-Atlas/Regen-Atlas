  description:
    "The primary objective of the Agrocortex REDD+ Project is to avoid the unplanned deforestation (AUD) of the 186,219 ha project area, consisting of 100% Amazon rainforest. Over the next 30 years, this project will help reduce over 14 million tonnes of CO2 from entering the atmosphere! Furthermore, the project has been lauded for its protection of the Amazon’s rich biodiversity. The project region has one of the highest species richness of birds in the world, lying inside a worldwide birdlife endemic area. Fauna surveys conducted on the Project area indicated the presence of 345 species of birds (which represents 18% of total species cataloged in Brazil). MCO2 (“Moss Carbon Credit”) is a blockchain-based ERC20 token that represents ownership of one carbon credit (i.e., a digital certificate in the voluntary market that attests the avoidance of the emission of 1 ton of GEE in carbon dioxide equivalent units) registered with a globally recognized registry.",
