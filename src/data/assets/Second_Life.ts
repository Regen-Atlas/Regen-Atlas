    "NFT issued to buyers of Plastic Cleanup Forward Contracts.\n\nThis social enterprise committed to giving a “Second Life” to plastic waste. By working in partnership with local collectors and recycling initiatives, they believe that companies can be part of the solution to support circular plastic supply chains and generate new sources of incomes for vulnerable communities. Their goal is to cover all island territories in Thailand and Indonesia, with a goal to collect and recycle 50,000,000 kgs per year from these beaches and island communities. To date, they have already collected and recycled 2,000,000 kgs and their network continues to expand.",
