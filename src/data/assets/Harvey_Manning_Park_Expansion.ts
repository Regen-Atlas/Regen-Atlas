  description:
    'The Harvey Manning Park Expansion, covering 15.14 acres, is part of the 33-acre area in the "Issaquah Alps" - Tiger, Squak, and Cougar Mountains - overlooking Lake Sammamish. Located within Issaquah and the Mountains to Sound Greenway National Heritage corridor, this century-old forest features riparian and wetland areas vital for wildlife on Cougar Mountain. It also safeguards freshwater streams leading to Tibbetts Creek, crucial for salmon in Lake Sammamish. The City of Issaquah collaborated with the community, King County, and the Trust for Public Land for its protection.',
