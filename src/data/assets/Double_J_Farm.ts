  description:
    "Farm owners started ridge tilling in the early 80â€™s as a way to reduce tillage, fuel, fertilizer, and chemicals. They later switched to zone, vertical, and no till in 2013 when ridge till became too labor intensive. Then, they started using more hog manure and chicken litter in 2013. They've started to use more cover crops recently and they like to look at fields with residue or cover.",
