    "description": "The farm has been farmed continuously since that year by Roger, and his son, Matt, utilizing “no-till.” Upon our purchase of the land, we leased the land to Roger and Matt, and they have continued the “no-till” practice on the farm. Since 2020, we have added cover crops to the land. We are considering incorporating a small grain crop into the traditional corn soybean rotation. The advantage of “no-till” is in the utilization of the decomposition of the previous year’s crop residue into the soil increasing the health of the soil. Healthy soil increases the activity of earthworms in the soil helping with moisture retention in the soil.",
