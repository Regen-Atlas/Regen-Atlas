    "description": "This NFTree, offered by Coorest, combines digital ownership with environmental impact, representing a real tree planted in Caspe, Spain, in June 2022. It's a yield-bearing asset (usufruct) providing two forms of return: (1) CO2 absorption benefits, with the tree absorbing 81 kilos of CO2 annually, mirrored by the issuance of equivalent CO2 tokens (1kg CO2 = 1 CO2 token). These tokens can be claimed, traded, or converted into a Proof of Carbon Compensation Certificate (PoCC) on the Coorest platform. (2) Financial returns from the sale of the tree's fruit, commencing in the fourth year (2024), with an anticipated yield of 20%.",
