  description:
    "NFT issued to buyers of Plastic Cleanup Forward Contracts.\n\nThalassains is committed to helping create a more sustainable future in the world. We will achieve that by using the power of business & collaborations to pave the path to that sustainable future. The founder was inspired to start this business after observing an overwhelming increase in plastic stuck in the world-class coral reefs of The Red Sea in 2020. After observing the negative impact of plastics on our corals, he realized that something has to be done to preserve the Red Sea. He hired a few friends and created a purpose-driven organization concerned with guarding the sea. Now, Thalassains manages one of the largest & most consistent beach cleanup operations in Egypt & recruits 100s of volunteers & staff.",
