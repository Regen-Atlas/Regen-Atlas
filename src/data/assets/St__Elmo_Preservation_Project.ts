    "Lookout Mountain, spanning over 90 miles across Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia, is a globally significant ecoregion for its biodiversity. The 58-acre oak-pine forest, nestled between the Chickamauga & Chattanooga National Military Park and the St. Elmo neighborhood, is crucial for connecting habitat corridors. Its protection by the Conservancy supports vital habitats for species like eastern box turtles, red-tailed hawks, black bears, and spotted salamanders.",
