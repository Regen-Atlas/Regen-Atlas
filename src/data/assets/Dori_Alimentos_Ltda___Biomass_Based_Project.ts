  description:
    "Dori Alimentos is a manufacturing industry in São Paulo specialized in candies production, peanut confectionery and other products, and has factories located in Marília/SP and Rolândia/PR. For decades, the company has used shale oil as fuel in the factory’s boilers, a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2006, aiming to reduce its environmental impact, Dori switched the use of fossil fuel to renewable biomass. MCO2 (“Moss Carbon Credit”) is a blockchain-based ERC20 token that represents ownership of one carbon credit (i.e., a digital certificate in the voluntary market that attests the avoidance of the emission of 1 ton of GEE in carbon dioxide equivalent units) registered with a globally recognized registry.",
