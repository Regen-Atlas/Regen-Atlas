Since 2020, we have added cover crops to the land. We are considering incorporating a small grain crop into the traditional corn soybean rotation. The advantage of “no-till” is in the utilization of the decomposition of the previous year’s crop residue into the soil increasing the health of the soil. Healthy soil increases the activity of earthworms in the soil helping with moisture retention in the soil.",

India, with its vast solar potential, can significantly reduce its carbon footprint by transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar power. By supporting solar projects, users contribute to the expansion of clean energy infrastructure, which not only mitigates environmental degradation but also fosters economic growth and creates employment opportunities. Additionally, investing in solar energy helps diversify India's energy mix, enhancing energy security and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Ultimately, funding solar projects in India not only promotes environmental stewardship but also paves the way for a brighter, more sustainable future for generations to come.
